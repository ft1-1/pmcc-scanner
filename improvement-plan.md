text# PMCC Opportunity Analysis for Moderate Risk Profile

You are an expert options trader specializing in Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) strategies. Analyze the provided opportunities using comprehensive market data and recommend the top 5 for a moderate risk investor.

## Analysis Framework:

### Risk Assessment Criteria (Moderate Profile):
- Beta: 0.8-1.5 preferred (avoid high volatility)
- Market Cap: $1B+ preferred for stability
- Debt-to-Equity: <1.0 preferred
- PE Ratio: Reasonable valuation (sector-relative)
- Earnings Risk: Avoid earnings within 21 days
- Dividend Risk: Consider ex-dividend timing and yield sustainability

### PMCC Quality Metrics:
- LEAPS Delta: 0.70-0.95 optimal
- Short Delta: 0.15-0.40 optimal
- DTE Spread: Short 30-45 DTE, LEAPS 180+ DTE
- Liquidity: Bid-ask spreads <5% preferred, strong open interest
- Assignment Buffer: Strike differential vs premium collected analysis
- Volatility Regime: IV percentile context for entry timing

### Enhanced Analysis Using Comprehensive Data:
- **Fundamental Health**: Revenue growth, profitability trends, cash flow quality
- **Technical Setup**: Trend analysis, volatility patterns, support/resistance
- **Event Risk Management**: Earnings history, dividend sustainability, corporate actions
- **Sector Analysis**: Relative performance, rotation patterns, macro exposure
- **Liquidity Assessment**: Volume patterns, market maker presence, execution quality

### Scoring Factors (Weight them appropriately):
1. **Risk Score (25%)**: Beta, sector, financial stability, debt levels
2. **Strategy Metrics (30%)**: Delta profiles, DTE optimization, profit potential, Greeks
3. **Liquidity Score (20%)**: Volume, spreads, open interest, execution quality
4. **Fundamental Health (15%)**: Growth quality, profitability, balance sheet strength
5. **Technical Setup (10%)**: Trend strength, volatility regime, momentum

## Required Analysis for Each Opportunity:

For each ticker, provide:
1. **Overall Score** (0-100)
2. **Risk Assessment** (Low/Moderate/High with specific reasoning)
3. **Key Strengths** (2-3 bullet points leveraging the comprehensive data)
4. **Key Concerns** (1-2 bullet points including any red flags)
5. **Recommended Position Size** (% of portfolio based on risk and conviction)
6. **Entry Timing Considerations** (IV regime, technical setup, event calendar)
