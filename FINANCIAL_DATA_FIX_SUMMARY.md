# Financial Data Fix Summary

## Issue
The Claude AI prompts were missing critical financial data sections (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, analyst sentiment) even though EODHD was providing this data.

## Root Cause
The enhanced_eodhd_provider.py was returning FundamentalMetrics objects instead of the filtered dictionary format that includes financial statement data extracted from the nested EODHD response structure.

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated enhanced_eodhd_provider.py** (line 1187):
   - Changed from using FundamentalMetrics.from_eodhd_response() to always using filter_fundamental_data()
   - This ensures financial data is extracted from fundamentals['Financials']['Balance_Sheet']['quarterly'] etc.

2. **Updated scanner.py** (lines 1223-1233):
   - Added income_statement section extraction to _enhanced_stock_data_to_dict method
   - Added 'income_statement' to PRESERVE_SECTIONS in _filter_null_empty_fields (line 1597)

## Results
✅ Financial data is now properly included in Claude prompts:
- **Balance Sheet**: Total Assets, Total Debt, Cash, Working Capital, Debt/Equity ratio
- **Cash Flow**: Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, CapEx, Dividends Paid
- **Income Statement**: Revenue, Gross/Operating/Net Income, Margins
- **Analyst Sentiment**: Ratings, Price Targets, Analyst Counts

## Testing Verified
- EODHD returns complete financial data for KSS stock
- Scanner properly converts and preserves all financial sections
- Claude prompt includes financial data in the formatted text style:
  - "BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH: Total Debt: 7371M | Total Assets: 13639M..."
  - "CASH FLOW ANALYSIS: Free Cash Flow: -202M | Operating Cash Flow: -92M"

## Files Modified
1. `/src/api/providers/enhanced_eodhd_provider.py` - Line 1187
2. `/src/analysis/scanner.py` - Lines 1223-1233, 1597

The financial data is now successfully flowing from EODHD → Scanner → Claude prompts as intended.
