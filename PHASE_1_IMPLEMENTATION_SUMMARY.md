- **Factory Pattern**: Seamlessly integrated with existing provider factory
- **Circuit Breakers**: Enhanced provider respects existing error handling patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching reduces API costs for expensive operations

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Stock Data
```python
from src.api.providers.enhanced_eodhd_provider import EnhancedEODHDProvider
from src.api.data_provider import ProviderType

provider = EnhancedEODHDProvider(ProviderType.EODHD, {
    'api_token': 'your_eodhd_token'
})

# Get comprehensive stock data
response = await provider.get_enhanced_stock_data('AAPL')
enhanced_data = response.data

print(f"Data completeness: {enhanced_data.data_completeness_score}%")
print(f"PE Ratio: {enhanced_data.fundamentals.pe_ratio}")
print(f"Next earnings: {enhanced_data.upcoming_earnings_date}")
```

### Provider Factory Integration
```python
from src.api.provider_factory import DataProviderFactory, ProviderConfig

factory = DataProviderFactory()
factory.register_provider(ProviderConfig(
    provider_type=ProviderType.EODHD,
    provider_class=EnhancedEODHDProvider,
    config={'api_token': 'your_token'},
    preferred_operations=['get_enhanced_stock_data']
))

# Use enhanced features through factory
